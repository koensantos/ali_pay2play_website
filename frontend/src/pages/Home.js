      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p>
        This project promotes transparency around donations given to Jersey City mayoral candidates.
        Our data covers 2025 campaign contributions, including any pay-to-play donations starting from 2020.
        Pay2Play exists to empower voters with accessible donation records and to support informed decision-making.
        We do not endorse any candidateâ€”our goal is to let the data speak for itself.
      </p>
